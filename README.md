# Live Colors

This mod shows a live visualization of the colors on screen, including pulses and color changes. It lets you modify the color channel directly by clicking on them as well.

When using this mod, it is recommended to use BetterEdit's UI scale and set it below 0.925 to see more colors on the screen and reduce clutter.
